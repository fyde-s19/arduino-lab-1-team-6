a.Why do embedded systems need a setup and a loop?
-The setup initializes environment variables, while the loop allows the system to respond to the outside world in real-time.



b.Why does our code need to be compiled?
-Since our embedded system executes in machine code, our human code needs to be translated into a language that the computer can understand.



c.When lowering the frequency in step four, what is going wrong? Brainstormsome solutions. 
Dimmers exist in the real world. What is their solution?
-We noticed that lowering the frequency on the dimmer (with constant 50% duty cycle) would cause it to flash rapidly (and then slowly).
This is because our eyes began to pick up on the rapid changes in the blinking of the LED. In the real world, engineers would usually
keep the frequency sufficiently high such that humans don't notice the rapid changes in LED.
